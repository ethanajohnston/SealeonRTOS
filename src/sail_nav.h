 * Inputs:
 *   wp:      the current way point's position
 *   gps:     the most recent GPS reading
 *   wind:    the most recent wind vane reading
 *   heading: the average heading
 *
 * Inputs/Outputs:
 *   course:     pointer to the target course, which will be updated when the function returns
 *   sail_angle: pointer to the required sail angle for the given course
